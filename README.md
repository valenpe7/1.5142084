# Recoil Effects on Reflection from Relativistic Mirrors in Laser Plasmas

This repository contains the analysis of data used in the work "Recoil Effects on Reflection from Relativistic Mirrors in Laser Plasmas" that has been published in Physics of Plasmas (https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5142084). All the data was computed by the EPOCH particle-in-cell code (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0741-3335/57/11/113001). The raw data is available on Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/record/3707924#.XmpGHag2pPY)
